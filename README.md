# STM32F103C8T6 UART Bit Banging Example

I am trying to learn how do communication protocols work so I am learningthem by replicating them by software. There is just data sending for now and no functions and such, but I will turn it into libary and It will recive data too. Right now it only can sen data 0x1F from B12 when B13 pin is inputed as high.
